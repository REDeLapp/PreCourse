## Install Git
If you run GNU/Linux, you can probably install git from your package manager;
it'll probably be called "git".

If you're on Windows or Mac, download Git from the [Git website](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Literature
You should understand (or be familiar with) the things in the following materials.
If you already know these topics, feel free to skip things.

* [Linus Torvalds on git](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)
* [git basics](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
* [Git vs. Github?](http://www.jahya.net/blog/?2013-05-git-vs-github)

You don't have to memorize anything; we mainly want you to know about these
things and feel comfortable typing things in a terminal.

## GitHub

## Assignment
Create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com), and push a file to it.
This will involve making a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
