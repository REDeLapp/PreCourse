# Shell

## Installing
When you write things in a terminal in Mac or GNU/Linux,
you are writing shell.

If you are running Windows, you can install a shell by
[installing Git](http://git-scm.com/download/win), which
you need for the git work anyway. Open the shell by
clicking the "Git Bash" option in the context menu.
