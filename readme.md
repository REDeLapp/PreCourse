# Zipfian Academy Precourse Curriculum

We we want you to be somewhat comfortable with the software environments you'll be using and general programming principles so we can jump into curriculum on day one.  There will be a workstation for each student setup with the required environment, so you do not need to worry about which versions of what to install on your computer or deal with the frustration of getting all the libraries to play nicely.

## Where to do exercises
You may find yourself writing notes and small bits of code throughout this precourse work.

This repository is a decent place to put those; fork this repository on GitHub so that you can add your notes and whatnot to it. This will also make it easier for us to help you should you have any questions or difficulty about the precourse work.

## Setup

Setting up a data science environment can often be a daunting process, especially for folks who may be new to programming and the Unix command line.  Thankfully we can stand on the shoulders of giants and somewhat painlessly get a Mac or Linux (sorry Windows) box setup in a few minutes with some smart scripting.

## Assignment

The `assignment/` folder contains various markdown files (`.md`).  Each of these has a section called 'Assignment'.  You should complete what is described in each of these sections.

There is a lot in this repository.  By far the most important things to focus on for day 1 are Python and UNIX/shell.  Listed below are some resources/tutorials that you should be able to complete and understand by the first day of class.  Please reach out if you have any questions on any of this.

## Test yourself

As long as you can complete what is described in the `project/` directory's readme.md you should be ready for the first day of class.  Also here are some technology specific tutorial to test your knowledge and focus your studying:

* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
* [UNIX/Python tutorial](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp12/projects/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Stats/Probability](http://courses.washington.edu/css490/2012.Winter/lecture_slides/02_math_essentials.pdf)

### Short project

In order for you to get familiar with a few different languages,
we'd like you to conduct a very basic analysis in Python and SQL.  __This is the best guide/test of your knowledge for the first day of class.

Follow the directions in the [project directory](project/readme.md), and
repeat the analysis in Python and SQL.

__NOTE: We will no longer be using R in the curriculum and you are not expected to know it__

## Order

There is no required order to complete the assignments in, but I will recommend one for ease of learning.  But everyone comes from different backgrounds and is more familiar with some of these than others.

1. [shell](assignment/shell.md)
2. [git](assignment/git.md)
3. [Python](assigment/python.md)
4. [SQL](sql/readme.md)
5. [the project](project/readme.md)
5. [Theory (math/stats/prob)](assignment/theory.md)

## Extra

The `extra` directory has some references on operating systems and text editors that you might consider installing and learning. It also references some tutorials on HTML, CSS, and javascript basics.

This is the least important part of the precourse work, so skip it if you don't have time.

### Blog

We would like you to blog throughout the course and reflect on what they have learned. `/blog` contains ideas of blogging software you could use. We expect you to have set up some sort of blog; it doesn't have to be fancy.

## Getting help
Feel free to email, call, &c. us whenever you could use some help with anything in the precourse work.

## References

List below are many great references to get a deeper dive in each of these topics.  By no means are you expected or required to go through all of these, we just wanted to give you a set of references to dive deeper.
