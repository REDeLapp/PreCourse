# Zipfian Academy Precourse Curriculum

### "I wish I did more precourse stuff." *â€“every single Zipfian graduate*
<br>
<br>
__Goal: to get you ready to jump into our curriculum on day 1.__

Please read this entire document before getting started on the following
sections.

Before class beings, you are expected read the contents in each chapter above, complete the code assignments for that chapter, and hand them in. 

Please complete and hand in each chapter sequentially. 

### How to hand-in/submit the assignments.
You will submit your solutions with a git [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Here are step by step instructions of how to do this:

1. Fork this repository (go to https://github.com/zipfian/precourse and click "Fork")
1. [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer
if you haven't already
1. Clone the repository on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/precourse`
1. Edit the assignment files with your solutions
1. Add your changes to the repository: `git add <file you edited>`
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "My solutions to precourse"`
1. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin master`
1. Make a pull request by going to https://github.com/zipfian/precourse and clicking "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request"

It's good workflow to commit and push to your fork often, even when you're not done. Then you have older versions of your work in case you screw something up or lose something. We will get a notification of your submission once you submit a pull request.

If we've made changes to the repository after you forked it and you want to update your repository to reflect them, you can run this command: `git pull https://github.com/zipfian/precourse master`
